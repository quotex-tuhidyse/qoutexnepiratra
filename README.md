# What is Quotex Trading? A Comprehensive Guide for Indian Traders

## Introduction

Quotex is an online broker that offers binary options trading. Binary
options are a financial product where your payoff is "all or
nothing" within a defined time frame. For example, if you believe
Microsoft stock will trade above \$100 in the next 2 minutes and it
does, you receive your money back plus a premium. If it doesn't, you
lose all your money.
